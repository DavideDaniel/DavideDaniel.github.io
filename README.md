2. The project includes:
   - Copilot instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - VS Code settings for optimal Copilot experience
   - `@ai-context` tags in code comments for better suggestions

### Claude Code Setup

The project structure and comments are designed to work seamlessly with Claude for:
- Code reviews and refactoring
- Adding new features
- Debugging and optimization
- Documentation

### AI-Friendly Patterns

- **Comprehensive comments** with `@ai-context` tags
- **Consistent code structure** for better pattern recognition
- **JSDoc type annotations** for clear interfaces and better AI understanding
- **Modular components** for easier understanding

## 📝 Code Style

- **ESLint** configuration for React + JSX
- **Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **JSDoc** for inline type documentation and AI assistance
- Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
- Run `npm run format` to auto-format code

## 🎨 Pages

## 🔄 Migration from Static Site

The original static site (HTML/CSS/jQuery) has been refactored into a modern React application:

- ✅ Vite + React + JavaScript setup
- ✅ Multi-page routing with React Router
- ✅ New welcome page
- ✅ Assets migrated to public folder
- ✅ Modern CSS with custom properties
- ✅ JSDoc annotations for AI assistance
- ⏳ Bio page content migration (in progress)
- ⏳ jQuery to React hooks conversion

The original static site is preserved in `old-static-site/` for reference.
